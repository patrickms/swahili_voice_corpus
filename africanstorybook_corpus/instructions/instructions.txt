Each line begins with a filename of a wav, e.g. "KW_001.wav" line (I want lots of ".wav" files). Please don't read the file name. The rest of the line in quotes should be read.
This should be very similar to the order I sent you in September. If you can do this order quickly (by Friday) and can do more orders 
quickly, I have another order immediately after.

Please speak slowly and clearly, like reading to a child.

I will use this to make text to speech software.
